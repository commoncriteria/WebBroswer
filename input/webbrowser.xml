    <chapter title="Introduction" id="int">
        <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview">Web browsers are client applications that retrieve
            and render content provided by web servers, primarily using the hypertext transfer
            protocol (HTTP) or HTTP Secure (HTTPS). Browsers have grown in complexity over the
            years, starting as tools used to display simple, unchanging web pages and becoming
            sophisticated execution environments for web content. The use of browsers to administer
            accounts, servers or embedded systems remotely requires them to handle sensitive
            information securely. Innovations such as tabs, extensions and HTML5 have not only
            increased browser functionality, but also introduced new security concerns. Being the
            principal method for accessing the Internet, and due to their complexity and the
            information that they process, browsers are a natural target for attackers. As a result,
            it is paramount that the security of web browsers be improved to reduce the risk to
            client machines and enterprise networks.<br/> This Extended Package (EP) along with the
            Protection Profile for Application Software (<cite linkend="bibAppPP"/>) provide a
            baseline set of Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) for web browsers running on any
            operating system regardless of the composition of the underlying platform. The
            requirements are intended to improve the security of browsers by encouraging the use of
            operating system security services and requiring the use of sandboxing technologies and
            environmental mitigations provided by the underlying platform. Additionally, these
            requirements define security functionality that browsers must provide.<br/>The terms web
            browser, browser, and TOE are interchangeable in this document. </section>

            technology terms used in this Extended Package. <subsection

            to address the security problems in the use cases below. These use cases are
            intentionally very broad, as web browsers can be used to perform many tasks. <usecases>
                <usecase title="Surfing the Web">
                    <description> Browsers are used to retrieve, display and render content from the
                        web, such as web pages, streaming media, images and specialized formats
                        (e.g., Java, Flash, PDF). They can also be used to write content to web
                        sites (web 2.0 – e.g., Facebook). Web surfing can be done over the Internet
                        or within an Intranet.</description>
                </usecase>
                <usecase title="Remote Administration Client">
                    <description> Browsers are used to provide remote administration interfaces for
                        systems such as servers, network devices and embedded systems, to include
                        supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, smart TVs and
                        thermostats. As opposed to surfing the web, where the browser may be
                        interacting with untrusted content, the browser, acting as a Remote
                        Administration Client, is connecting to a server that the user
                        trusts.</description>

                <usecase title="Content Creation">
                    <description> Browsers are used to create content via an increasing number of
                        Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings, including Microsoft Office 365,
                        Google Drive, and Adobe Creative Cloud, where user data and records are

                <description> The Protection Profile for Application Software (<cite

                    (SFRs) and Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) for application software
                    products. This <abbr linkend="EP"/> serves to extend the App PP baseline with
                    additional SFRs and associated Assurance Activities specific to a web browser.
                    Assurance Activities are the actions that the evaluator performs in order to
                    determine a web browser's compliance to the SFRs.<br/> This <abbr linkend="EP"/>

                    Part 3 conformant. In order to be conformant to this <abbr linkend="EP"/>, the

    <chapter title="Security Problem Description" id="spd"> The security problem is described in
        terms of the threats that the web browser is expected to address, assumptions about the
        operational environment, and any organizational security policies that it is expected to
        enforce. <br/> This Extended Package does not repeat the threats, assumptions, and
        organizational security policies identified in the App PP, though they all apply given the
        conformance and hence dependence of this <abbr linkend="EP"/> on it. Together the threats,
        assumptions and organizational security policies of the App PP and those defined in this
            <abbr linkend="EP"/> describe those addressed by a web browser as the Target of
        Evaluation. <br/> Notably, browsers are particularly at risk from the Network Attack threat
        identified in the App PP. Attackers can use phishing or another social engineering technique
        to persuade a user to visit a malicious site. Users may also unintentionally visit malicious
        sites in the course of web browsing. Such sites then present malicious content to the user's
        browser to exploit it and perform installation of malware, often with no indication to the
        user. <section title="Threats" id="threattable">The following threats are specific to web
            browsers, and represent an addition to those identified in the App PP.<threats>
                <threat id="T.FLAWED_ADDON">
                    <description> Web browser functionality can be extended through the integration
                        of third-party utilities and tools. Malicious or vulnerable add-ons could
                        result in attacks against the system. Such attacks can allow unauthorized
                        access to sensitive information in the browser, unauthorized access to the
                        platform's file system, or even privilege escalation that enables
                        unauthorized access to other applications or the operating
                        system.</description>

                <threat id="T.SAME-ORIGIN_VIOLATION">
                    <description> Violating the same-origin policy is a specialized type of network
                        attack (covered generally as T.NETWORK_ATTACK in the App PP) which involves
                        web content violating access control policies enforced by a web browser to
                        separate the content of different web domains. It is specifically identified
                        as a threat to web browsers, since they implement the access control
                        policies that are violated in these attacks. <br/> Attacks which involve
                        same origin violations include: <ul>
                            <li>Insufficient protection of session tokens can lead to session
                                hijacking, where a token is captured and reused in order to gain the
                                privileges of the user who initiated the session.</li>
                            <li>Cross-site scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
                                attacks are methods used to compromise user credentials (usually by
                                stealing the user's session token) to a web site. These attacks are
                                more likely a result of server security problems, but some browsers
                                incorporate technologies that try to detect the attacks.</li>
                            <li>Inadequate sandboxing of browser windows/tabs or a faulty cross
                                domain communications model can lead to leakage of content from one
                                domain in one window/tab to a different domain in a different
                                window/tab. Such attacks leverage the ability of browsers to display
                                content from multiple domains simultaneously.</li>

        add-ons, or vendor supplied add-ons which do not adhere to the browser's sandbox, to
        accomplish these requirements. Security requirements comprise functional components from
        Part 2 of <cite linkend="bibCC"/>. The following notations are used: <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Selection</b> (denoted by <i>italicized text</i>): is used to select one or more

                        <note role="application"> Web browsers implement a variety of methods to
                            ensure that the process that renders HTML and interprets JavaScript
                            operates in a constrained environment in order to reduce the risk that
                            the rendering process can be corrupted by the HTML or JavaScript it is
                            processing. This component requires the browser to lower the privileges
                            of rendering processes by ensuring that it cannot directly access the
                            file system of the host, and that it cannot use <abbr linkend="IPC"/>
                            mechanisms provided by the host to communicate with non-browser
                            processes on the host. Typically, if a rendering process needs to access
                            a file or communicate with a non-browser process, it must request such
                            access through the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> (which is allowed by the
                            requirement).<br/> In addition to the two required measures, other
                            measures can be implemented depending on the browser and the host
                            platform. These may involve such actions as changing the owner of the
                            rendering process to a low-privileged account or dropping
                            platform-defined privileges in the rendering process. The <abbr
                                linkend="ST"/> author fills in the additional measures implemented

                                describes how the rendering of HTML and interpretation of JavaScript
                                is performed by the browser in terms of the platform processes that
                                are involved (with "process" being an active entity that executes
                                code). For the processes that render HTML or interpret JavaScript,
                                the evaluator shall examine the <abbr linkend="TSS"/> to check that
                                it describes how these processes are prevented from accessing the
                                platform file system. The evaluator shall check the <abbr
                                    linkend="TSS"/> to ensure it describes each platform-provided
                                    <abbr linkend="IPC"/> mechanism, and details for each mechanism
                                how the rendering process is unable to use it to communicate with
                                non-browser processes. The evaluator shall also confirm that the
                                    <abbr linkend="TSS"/> describes how <abbr linkend="IPC"/> and
                                file system access is enabled (if this capability is implemented);
                                for instance, through a more privileged browser process that does
                                not perform web page rendering. The evaluator shall ensure that
                                these descriptions are present for all platforms claimed in the

                                ensure 1) the mechanisms are described; 2) the description of the
                                mechanisms are sufficiently detailed to determine that it
                                contributes to the principle of least privilege being implemented in
                                the rendering process; and 3) appropriate supporting information is
                                provided in the <abbr linkend="TSS"/> (or pointers to such
                                information are provided) that provides context for understanding

                                are configurable (for instance, if a user can choose which
                                mechanisms to "turn on"), the evaluator shall examine the

                            Ultimately, the result should be that the browser blocks the connection

    <appendix title="Optional Requirements" id="optional"> The baseline requirements (those that
        must be performed by the web browser are contained in the main body of this <abbr
            linkend="EP"/>. Additionally, there are three other types of requirements specified in
            <appref linkend="optional"/>, <appref linkend="sel-based"/>, and <appref
            linkend="objective"/>. The first type (in this Appendix) are requirements that can be
        included in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>, but are not required in order for a browser to claim
        conformance to this <abbr linkend="EP"/>. The second type (in <appref linkend="sel-based"/>)
        are requirements based on selections in the body of the <abbr linkend="EP"/>: if certain
        selections are made, then additional requirements in that appendix must be included. The
        third type (in <appref linkend="objective"/>) are components that are not required in order
        to conform to this <abbr linkend="EP"/>, but will be included in the baseline requirements
        in future versions of this <abbr linkend="EP"/>, so adoption by vendors is encouraged. Note
        that the <abbr linkend="ST"/> author is responsible for ensuring that requirements that may
        be associated with those in <appref linkend="optional"/>, <appref linkend="sel-based"/>, and
            <appref linkend="objective"/> but are not listed (e.g., FMT-type requirements) are also
        included in the ST.</appendix>
    <appendix title="Selection-Based Requirements" id="sel-based">As indicated in the introduction
        to this <abbr linkend="EP"/>, the baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the
        browser or its underlying platform) are contained in the App PP and in the body of this
            <abbr linkend="EP"/>. There are additional requirements based on selections from the App
        PP and/or in the body of the <abbr linkend="EP"/>: if certain selections are made, then
        additional requirements below will need to be included.</appendix>
    <appendix title="Objective Requirements" id="objective"> This Annex includes requirements that
        specify security functionality which also addresses threats. The requirements are not
        currently mandated in the body of this <abbr linkend="EP"/> as they describe security
        functionality not yet widely-available in commercial technology. However, these requirements
        may be included in the <abbr linkend="ST"/> such that the browser is still conformant to
        this <abbr linkend="EP"/>, and it is expected that they be included as soon as
        possible.</appendix>
